WebClaw is intentionally simple.
The goal is to build the best web client for openclaw, not the biggest one.

Before opening a PR

- keep changes small and focused
- avoid adding heavy dependencies or complexity
- discuss big ideas in an issue first

What we welcome

- performance improvements
- streaming / chat UX improvements
- bug fixes
- small, clear UI polish
- docs that make setup easier

What we avoid

- large refactors without clear benefit
- opinionated features that add weight
- anything that hurts simplicity or local-first usage

PR rules

- one change per PR
- clear title + short description
- screenshots or video for UI changes
- must run locally with zero friction
